Comment: Copyright was established by examining the git history of both
 projects, and with discussion with both upstreams, found at:
 https://github.com/dholm/tabbar/issues/31
 https://github.com/davidswelt/aquamacs-emacs/issues/138
 I wrote:
     1. Given that it's a fork of Aquamacs TabBarMode, does "the Aquamacs
        Project" hold the copyright for everything that isn't attributed to
        someone else, excluding the READMEs, which are presumably yours?
        From what I can tell "everything else" would be all of the images.
     2. Why are up.png and down.png not converted to tiff? I found the
        instructions for conversion in README, but couldn't find an
        explanation.
 dholm replied:
     1. Yes, that's correct.
     2. The instructions are from Aquamacs and I don't know why some of them
        were converted to tiff. Perhaps we should revert back to the original
        pngs.
 Aquamacs plans to add copyright info for Tabbar, then, dholms's project
 can sync the file, at which time we can sync with his and these comments
 can be dropped.

 and also by examining the git history of both projects.  These two files
 were originally committed by "champo", and this is documented in dholm's
 copy, but not in davidswelt's.  At issue 138 on 26 Jul 2018, I wrote
 'After reading aquamacs/Icons/build/COPYING it sounds like [down.png and
 up.png might also be copyright Adrian Chromenko], assuming that "champo"
 is Adrian Chromenko'.  Later that day github user 'nathaniel' replied
     Hi Nicholas,
     I (Nathaniel Cunningham) am champo (my original sourceforge username).
     I created the tabbar icons (not Adrian Chromenko).
 Aquamacs plans to add copyright info for Tabbar, then, dholms's project
 can sync the file, at which time we can sync with his and these comments
 can be dropped.  At this time it sounds like Nathaniel Cunningham has
 assigned copyright to The Aquamacs Project.
